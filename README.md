# BART Ridership Project
## Goal
The goal of this project was to analyze ridership data of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in the years 2020-2021. Additionally, several subtopics were investigated, such as: COVID-19 effect on ridership, the impact the new Silicon Valley Phase 1 stations had on the system, and how the modernization of a busy station affected its ridership.

## Method
The data itself was downloaded from the BART website. It provides monthly spreadsheets of ridership data in the form of a matrix. People entering stations is the row values and people exiting stations is the column values. All monthly spreadsheets from the years 2020-2021 were used in this project.

The following tools were used for completing the data analysis:

* Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning, particularly for restructuring the data that would be difficult to do in SQL.

* Google BigQuery: Used for data cleaning. Also used to add new calculated fields and writing queries to analyze cleaned data.

* Tableau: Used to visualize data. Charts such as bar charts, maps, and bubble charts were used for visualizing the data.

* Microsoft PowerPoint: Used to create the presentation. Contains a slideshow that walks through my findings with charts, statistics, and definitions.
